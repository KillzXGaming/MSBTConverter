# MSBT Converter

A msbt converter that can convert msbt to yaml and back.
The main purpose of this tool is to support additional msbt features other tools lack.
This tool includes attributes, tags, msbp labeling all thanks to the CLMS library.

## Usage

Before using, I suggest putting the game's .msbp file in the MessageProject directory.
This will label all attributes and tag info, which will make it much more readable.

Drag/drop a .msbt to the tool to turn into yaml. 
Drag/drop the yaml back to create a new msbt.
